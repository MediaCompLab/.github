## 🔬 About Us

Welcome to the Media Comprehension Lab, directed by Joe Magliano. We're on a mission to decode the intricate processes behind how humans understand and interact with various forms of media.

## 🎯 Our Research Focus

### 1. 📚🎬 Cross-Media Experience

    C[TV/Movies] --> D
```
We investigate how adults process information across different media types, exploring the commonalities and unique aspects of these experiences.

### 2. 🧠💪 Individual Variability

We study the diverse factors that contribute to an individual's success in processing media, with implications for educational and professional preparedness.

### 3. 🗣️🖥️ Constructed Responses
We employ innovative methodologies to analyze how adults articulate their understanding of various media through writing or speech, gaining insights into cognitive processes.
